Mortality forecasts are used in a wide variety of academic fields, and for global and national health policy making, medical and pharmaceutical research, and social security and retirement planning.\r\n<br /> <br />  As it turns out, the tools we developed in pursuit of this goal also have broader statistical implications, in addition to their use for forecasting mortality or other variables with similar statistical properties. First, our methods make it possible to include different explanatory variables in a time series regression for each cross-section, while still borrowing strength from one regression to improve the estimation of all. Second, we show that many existing Bayesian (hierarchi\r\ncal and spatial) models with explanatory variables use prior densities that incorrectly formalize prior knowledge. Many demographers and public health researchers have fortuitously avoided this problem so prevalent in other fields by using prior knowledge only as an ex post check on empirical results, but this approach excludes considerable information from their models. We show how to incorporate this demographic knowledge into a model in a statistically appropriate way. Finally, we develop a set of tools useful for developing models with Bayesian priors in the presence of partial prior ignorance. This approach also provides many of the attractive features claimed by the empirical Bayes approach, but fully within the standard Bayesian theory of inference.\r\n<br /> <br />  See also:   <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/category/research-interests/applications/mortality-studies\" target=\"_blank\">Mortality Studies</a>  ,   <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/category/research-interests/methods/event-counts-and-durations\" target=\"_blank\">Event Counts and Durations</a>"},"citation:Contact":{"datasetContact:E-mail":"king@mailinator.com"},"Related Publication":{"Citation":"Girosi, Federico, and Gary King. 2008.
